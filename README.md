## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent activities in credit card transactions. The model is trained on the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for different stages of the project.
- `src/`: Python scripts for reusable code.

## Data Collection
- **Dataset:** [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Source:** Kaggle

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values.
- Normalized numerical features.
- No encoding for categorical variables in this dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explored feature distributions, correlations, and outliers.

## Feature Engineering
- Created a new feature, 'Hour,' representing the hour of the day for each transaction.

## Additional Visualizations
- Learning Curves.
- SHAP Values or Feature Importance Plot.
- Testing the Model - Sample Input and Predicted Output Comparison.

## Results
- Precision: 0.97
- Recall: 0.79
- F1-score: 0.87
- Accuracy: 0.80

## Next Steps
- Fine-tune the model further.
- Implement continuous monitoring.
- Evaluate the model on new, unseen data.
- Enhance model explainability with additional visualizations.
